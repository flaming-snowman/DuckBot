# Duck Bot
Duck Bot is a Discord bot I created for myself and my friends on the Discord server "Ducks" and was my first large scale project. Developed when I knew very little about programming, Duck Bot was a great learning experience, but the code is of limited quality. This repo serves as an archive of the memories formed in Ducks and through developing Duck Bot.
## History
Ducks was created on March 24, 2018. Mere days after Ducks was created, development of Duck Bot began on March 26, 2018. The first feature to be introduced was a command that displayed a random duck picture. A few days into development would spawn Storyboard (formerly recipes), allowing users to submit posts to a central channnel where other users can upvote/downvote them. About a week later, Duck Bot would receive it's next major feature: Harvest Simulator. Based on AoPS Reaper, Harvest Simulator is an addicting game where everyone competes for the same pool of crops that grows over time. Players must wait between harvesting, so harvesting wisely is crucial to winning. Harvest Simulator remained the most popular feature throughout the existence of Ducks, with over 25 active players at its peak. Shortly thereafter, a server currency was established, rewarding those who participated in Harvest Simulator. The most popular stories of the week would also be awarded some currency and a special role. The currency update also brought about a shop, where users could spend currency to buy colored roles, as well as a daily command to earn additional currency. In May 2018, the ability to play trivia and commands for users to manage private voice channels was added. Summer 2018 brought about the garden update, the largest update ever for Duck Bot, letting players collect a wide variety of seeds and grow them for currency. In Fall 2018, I naively leaked the bot token on the Internet, resulting in a malicious actor purging the entirety of Ducks, both channels and members. In the process of rebuilding the server, an invite and verification system was added to increase security. Ducks would remain somewhat active for the next 2 years, with users primarily interacting with Duck Bot. Duck Bot received no future major updates, but was regularly maintained to fix bugs and work with newer versions of the Discord API until October 12, 2020, marking the end of Duck Bot and Ducks.
